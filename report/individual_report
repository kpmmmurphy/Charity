Sign-off

	Over the course of the project, I spent on average about 5 hours hours per day, Monday to Friday, and 2 to 3 hours on the weekends. Coming 
	closer to the demonstation day, I found those hours incresing on the weekends, in order to ensure the system was ready and functional. As the 
	lead programmer on the project, I knew at the start of the project I would be required to perform more work than my team mates, but I chose
	the role as programmer to earn more experience in deadling with the implementation of larger software systems, and become more comfortable coding in a controlled envirnment. 
		I believe that each of members of our team performed excellently, and fufiled their role to the best of their ablility. Simply judging by time spend on the project, It was 40% my own work, 35% Kealan Smyth's effort and 25% of Teng Yu's. In saying this, as the lead programmer the final product was always going to require more effort on my part. As my team mates fufiled their individual roles to the higest standard, it allowed me as the programmer to focus on coding the system and debugging, without having to undertake tasks out side of my role to compensate for the lack of effort on a team member's part. This allowed the project to move swiftly along, without any major problems.  We did however share some of the coding of the system, Kealan implemented some basic account management functionality and Teng Yu helped develop the FAQ sections. The UI was a combined effort of the team. 


Individual Reports

	As stated previously, I was the lead programmer of the project. It was my job to take the design documents created and agreed on by our team and implement the system from them. I did allocate coding to both Kealn and Teng when nessesary, when the work load grew as the project progressed. 

	Tools used included - Netbeans, Sublime Text 3, Google Chrome and it's real time DOM analyser, GitHub for versioning and Mantis for bug tracking. 

	To communicate, we used Basecamp, an online service for project managment. It allowed us to post discussions, files and tasks, so that each member of the team could easily find any material needed to work on the project in one place. As a management tool, I cannot give it enough praise. It's easy to use design grealty aided in our project's development. 
		Also, as one of our members, Teng Yu, was away in China for 10 days during our project, we regularly e-mailed and talked via Skype message, which we both maintained a record of.
